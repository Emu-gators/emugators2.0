This file contains the default directories for different pieces of data that are required for the 
GUI program to function properly. It also contains some specific notes with regards to naming conventions
and locations of files.

Default GUI art image directory from root of the repo: ../ROMS/
Default ROM directory from root of the repository: ../ROMS/emugator/ROMs/
Default ROM image directory from root of the repository: ../ROMS/emugator/ROM_Carts/
Default Sound file directory from root of the repository: ../ROMS/emugator

Specific Notes for each set of data.

GUI Art Images:
These set of images paths and names are all hardcoded as they are linked to specific elements
within the GUI so the names of your files should match the names in mainwindow.cpp exactly. If you
change the name of any of the art name files be sure to update the paths in GUITesting/mainwindow.cpp.

ROM files and ROM Images:
The GUI program requires a folder which contains the ROM files of the games a user wishes to play
and another directory witht he ROM images for each rom file. Each pair of rom files and rom images
must have identical names, excluding the extensions.

Currently the the rom files must have an nes extension or some other 3 letter extension and the 
corresponding rom image must have a jpg extension.
