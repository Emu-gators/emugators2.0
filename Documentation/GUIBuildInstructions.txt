Instructions for building GUI from the command line
If running on a new board run these commands first:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install qtcreator
sudo apt install qt5-default

sudo apt-get build-dep qtmultimedia5-dev
sudo apt-get install qtmultimedia5-dev
sudo apt-get install libqt5multimedia5-plugins

One important thing to check in our project specifically is that the images, ROMs, and ROM images are located at the path specified locations in the code. Also should any new ROM
or ROM images be added, there should be no spaces or other special characters in the names besides '.'.
Once those commands have been run and you are in the GUI project directory(on our board emugators2.0/GUITesting) you will then run these commands:

qmake -project

Opening up the .pro file that is created from the previous line you will insert this line
without quotes: "QT += gui widgets multimedia"

Then run with the name of the .pro file corresponding to the GUI project directory.

qmake GUITesting.pro

make

Finally you will have your executable to run the GUI using the command with the name again
corresponding to your GUI directory name.

./GUITesting

To get the GUI to run on boot, first create a .desktop file with:

nano ~/.config/autostart/GUITest.desktop

If the "autostart" directory doesn't exist, make one with: 

mkdir ~/.config/autostart

Inside the GUITest.desktop file, paste the following:

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=GUITest
Exec=/home/emugators/Documents/other/emugators2.0old/GUITesting/GUITesting

After saving the .desktop file in the ~/.config/autostart directory, run this command:

sudo reboot

This should reboot the system and you should successfully see the program as soon as the boot is complete.
