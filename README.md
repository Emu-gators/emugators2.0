# emugators2.0
Continuation of work done by original EmuGators, building on their use of FCEUX to emulate the Famicom system.

## Work Completed
### Pre-Alpha Build
Rudolph Civil
Fatima Elfasi - Cloned and built previous team's efforts on local machine and worked on getting demo LUA script to work and ensured that ROMs and ROM cartidge images load too. Worked with Christian to build fceux emulator on Renegade board. Worked on clarifying build documentation based on snags we hit and how we worked around it. Arranged meeting for Emugators Supergroup (both teams) to show us the structure of their code-base and how to run their project. Worked on aesthetic choices and made mockups which inspired our new GUI.
Zachary Thrasher - Extenuating circumstances.
Christian Walk - Built previous team's progress on local machine with emugator_demo.lua script working properly. Research Qt libraries in C++ and started creating the interface based on the mockup in the design revision with the ROM images(image in pre-alpha documentation) currently not connected to FCEUX. Got board setup with Raspbian and worked with Fatima to get fceux emulator running with emugator_demo on the board(current lua script still not displaying due to dependency issue).

## Next Steps
Rudolph Civil
Fatima Elfasi - Research methods for implementing SNES emulation using either Snes9x or bsnes. Support with implementing smooth communication between GUI and emulator.
Zachary Thrasher - Zapper/Building on Renegade board other modular sections/alternative work to be determined.
Christian Walk - Running the stand alone GUI on the board/finishing design to look like mock up. Determining/implementing communication method to connect with FCEUX emulator.
