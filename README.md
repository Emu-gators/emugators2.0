# emugators2.0
Continuation of work done by original EmuGators, building on their use of FCEUX to emulate the Famicom system.

## Work Completed
### Pre-Alpha Build
Rudolph Civil
Fatima Elfasi
Zachary Thrasher - Extenuating circumstances.
Christian Walk - Built previous team's progress on local machine with emugator_demo.lua script working properly. Research Qt libraries in C++ and started creating the interface based on the mockup in the design revision with the ROM images(image in pre-alpha documentation) currently not connected to FCEUX. Got board setup with Raspbian and worked with Fatima to get fceux emulator running with emugator_demo on the board(current lua script still not displaying due to dependency issue).

## Next Steps
Rudolph Civil
Fatima Elfasi
Zachary Thrasher - Zapper/Building on Renegade board other modular sections/alternative work to be determined.
Christian Walk - Running the stand alone GUI on the board/finishing design to look like mock up. Determining/implementing communication method to connect with FCEUX emulator.
