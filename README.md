# Emugators 2.0

A project for the Microcomputer Musuem. Features a GUI that operates alongside FCEUX ([an open source NES emulator](https://github.com/TASEmulators/fceux)). 

## Build

Building requires two steps.

* First, build FCEUX according to the steps outlined in BuildInstructions.md.
* Second, build the GUI by executing the build.sh script.

## GUI

After launching the GUI by executing GUITesting, drag and drop the ROMs near the top of the screen onto the Famicom at the center of the GUI to load games.  

More information about the GUI can be found in the GUITesting folder.

## FCEUX

This project uses a modified version of FCEUX.
